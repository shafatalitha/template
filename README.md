## So, what will you do in the exercise?
You should add fully functional increment and decrement button for each `menu-item`. Here are some tasks that you have to do:
- [ ] Change "fillthis" in the HTML file to an appropriate code so that it'll produce the correct output
- [ ] Add some code in `script.js` so the increment and decrement button in the beverage section can work

### If you want a more challenging exercise, you can go to `advanced-template` branch
